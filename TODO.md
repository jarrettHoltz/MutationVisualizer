Notes on what needs to be done:

The addition of accessors and mutators was successful, but I think that a lot of the mutators can be deleted as I don't believe they are used anywhere (which actually makes the visibiilty of our fields better). Need to delete the mutators that are not used.

Mutant only has addTest capabilities. Does it need deleteTest capabilities?

Do we need tests for each accessor and mutator?

Need to add javadoc comments to all functions?
